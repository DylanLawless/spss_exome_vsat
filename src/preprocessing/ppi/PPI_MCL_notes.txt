Here are some notes for Mack - I hardcoded some file names and kep some old code versions until we finish and cleanup. 

## Path
/work/backup/gr-fe/lawless/spss/exome/src/ppi
/work/backup/gr-fe/lawless/spss/exome/data/ppi

## Datasets
whole_genome_v4_c7_400	ppi_whole_genome_v3.R	STRING quality score .4
whole_genome_v4_c7_700	ppi_whole_genome_v5.R	STRING quality score .7
whole_genome_v4_c7_900	ppi_whole_genome_v4.R	STRING quality score .9

Quality score .7 gave the most protein retained in pathways after clustering, therefore was the dataset used downstream. 

## Final result
write.csv(df, file=paste0("../../data/ppi/mcl_clusters_recode_df_", file_suffix, ".csv"), quote = FALSE)

/work/backup/gr-fe/lawless/spss/exome/data/ppi/mcl_clusters_recode_df_whole_genome_v5_c7_700.csv
