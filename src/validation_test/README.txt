The 41 variants of interst are in 
borghesi_Supplementary_Table_4.tsv
however, these only contain amino acid postion from unknown transcripts. 
The reference genome is ostensible GRCh37? 

The longer table was found which contains genomic coordinate position (but no amino acid positions)
Borghesi_table_1_171222_larger_variant_set.xlsx

I ran used the coordingate positions and formated with "chr" and +1 to create a bed file. This was run on https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver
as per https://www.biostars.org/p/65558/.

This gives hglft_genome_ae749_8fb250.bed.
