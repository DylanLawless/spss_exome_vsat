ACMGuru also performed a cohort summary for outcomes after joint analysis using the study handbook variables. Variants were included which can be exaplined as considered pathogenic, likely pathogenic (ACMG total score >= 1), or those with updated priors due to association in the PPI VSAT; 68 patients were identified. Values are indicated as median [min - max].
