# Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our project on analyzing rare variants in infection response protein pathways associated with sepsis in children. 
This repository contains all the code, data, and resources used in "Rare variants in infection response protein pathway associated with sepsis in children".

Our project explores the genetic underpinnings of immune response in pediatric sepsis, employing a combination of novel computational tools and in-depth statistical analysis. 
These tools include ProteoMCLustR for protein pathway clustering, SkatRbrain and Archipelago for advanced statistical analyses, and ACMGuru, untangleR, and AutoDestructR for clinical genetics interpretation.

In this repository, you will find structured directories containing R scripts and source code that demonstrate our workflow from data preparation through to variant analysis and interpretation. 
Each tool and method used in our study is documented in detail to aid reproducibility and further research in this critical area of pediatric healthcare.

Contributions and insights from readers are highly encouraged, as we aim to foster a collaborative environment to enhance our understanding of sepsis at the genetic level.
